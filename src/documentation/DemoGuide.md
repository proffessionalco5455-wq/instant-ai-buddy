## Sample Q&A Scenarios

### Technical Questions

**Q: "How does this compare to ChatGPT or other AI tools?"**
**A:** "Great question! While ChatGPT requires you to open a new tab and copy-paste content, Instant AI Buddy works directly on whatever page you're already on. It's designed for workflow integration, not as a standalone tool. Plus, you can customize it with your own prompt library for tasks specific to your work."

**Q: "What about privacy and data security?"**
**A:** "Privacy is a core feature. All prompts are stored locally on your device, and you control what data gets sent to AI services. We also offer a local-only mode for sensitive content, and you can see exactly what's being processed before it's sent."

**Q: "Does it slow down my browsing?"**
**A:** "Not at all. The extension is dormant until you press Ctrl+Space, so there's zero impact on page load times or browsing performance. When active, it uses minimal resources and the AI responses are typically under 2 seconds."

### Business Questions

**Q: "Who is this really for?"**
**A:** "Anyone who regularly uses AI for writing, analysis, or creativity but finds themselves constantly switching between their work and AI tools. We've seen especially strong adoption among marketing professionals, content creators, researchers, and customer support teams."

**Q: "How much does it cost?"**
**A:** "The extension itself is free. You bring your own AI API key - so you only pay for what you use, directly to OpenAI or your preferred AI provider. No monthly subscriptions, no per-user fees."

**Q: "Can teams share prompt libraries?"**
**A:** "Absolutely! Teams can export and share their prompt collections. Many companies create standardized prompt libraries for their communication style, industry terminology, or specific workflows."

### Feature Questions

**Q: "Can I use my own AI models?"**
**A:** "Yes! While we integrate seamlessly with OpenAI, the extension is designed to work with different AI providers. You can configure it to use Claude, local models, or any API-compatible service."

**Q: "What if I'm offline?"**
**A:** "The prompt library and text processing tools work offline. For AI responses, you'd need an internet connection, but the extension gracefully handles connection issues and can queue requests for when you're back online."

**Q: "Does it work on mobile?"**
**A:** "Currently, it's designed for desktop browsers where keyboard shortcuts and precise text selection work best. Mobile support is on our roadmap as mobile browsers add more extension capabilities."
